Basically, it works. But when i want to further enhance the functionality in handling gifv not loading problem, referring to that in folder 123, api request suddenly gone wrong and even more weird is that, even when i replace everything of the code in folder 123 by the workable code, the fail to retrieve api still persists. I guess it is something about github page cache. Anyway, so i open redditapi2 repository.
